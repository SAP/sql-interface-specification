# Data Protection and Privacy related Annotations

## Introduction

The processing of personal data is key in business processes. SAP's products must enable our customers to operate their applications in compliance with data protection laws. One way of enabling is applying DPP-related annotations. Via those annotations the specific DPP-related behavior can be enabled by the consumers.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
